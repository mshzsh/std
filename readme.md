# Secure Text Display Application for Wayland Linux

## Overview

The Secure Text Display Application for Wayland Linux is designed to address several critical needs in specific workspaces and scenarios:

1. **Quick Text Manipulation:** The application allows you to efficiently copy and manipulate text, making it easier to change and reuse sentences quickly.

2. **Password Input Verification:** Another crucial use case is entering passwords securely. By writing and copying a password before entering it into a website's input field, you can verify its accuracy even in the presence of potential keylogger malware on the target site.

3. **Wayland Linux Compatibility:** This project is specifically designed for Wayland Linux environments.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Secure Text Display Application, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A Wayland Linux environment.
- GTK+ and Wayland libraries.
- The "wl-clipboard" tool (for copying text to the clipboard).

## Usage

Using the application is straightforward:

1. **Compile and Run:** Compile and run the application in your Wayland Linux environment.

2. **Enter Text:** Enter the text or password you want to work with into the provided textbox.

3. **Copy Text:** Press the "Enter" key to copy the text to the clipboard securely. This action also closes the application.

4. **Paste and Use:** You can now paste the copied text into other applications or websites using "wl-paste."

## Custom Styling

The application allows you to customize the appearance of the text box. Edit the included `styles.css` file to adjust properties like background color, text color, and font size to suit your preferences.
